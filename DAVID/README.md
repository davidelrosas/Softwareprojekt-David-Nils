Softwareproject by David Daniel Rosas Marquez 


Hello and welcome to my part of the Softwareproject. In the Following Text I'll give a brief overview of my work throughout the semester, that I did for the course "Softwareprojekt: Machinelles Learnen für Lebenswissenschaftliche Daten". But first a couple of notes: 

1) This folder doesn't contain all of the scripts and files I wrote throughout the semester, but just the ones I thought are the most relevant to the course. I did this to avoid cluttering too much, but because of this some files might not run on their own. Still at least the neural network models inside the script should be able to be run just fine if used somewhwere else, with some minor adjustments althoug. 

2) A lot of the python scripts are extensively commented. I chose to leave the comments in, because they were part of my process to try to better understand certain machine learning concepts (As I was completely new to the topic), and to rationalize what was happening in the code. But this also means that a lot of the comments might contain unclear or outright wrong statements, a lot of typos and grammar errors. This goes especially for comments where I am trying to understand/explain certain concepts.

3) I divided my work into blocks called "Project_x" that thematically fit together. I did this to provide an easier to follow overview of my workin this semester (but also partly because I don't fully recall what exactly I did which week).

With this in mind now follows the Overview.

The First couple of weeks for me mostly involved getting into the topic of machine learning and artificial neural networks.  

difficulties: EVERYTHING

learned:    -What is a neural network
            -Forward Pass and Backpropagation (superficially)
            -how do neural networks "learn" using gradient descent
            -How to code and train a basic neural network
